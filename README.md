*Fabric Defect Detection using YOLOv8 Overview*

This repository contains the core implementation files for the undergraduate thesis:

**“An Intelligent Deep Learning–Driven System for Automated Fabric Defect Detection”**

The project focuses on detecting and localizing fabric defects using the YOLOv8 object detection framework, along with a lightweight web-based demonstration system.

***Repository Contents***
The following files are included in this GitHub repository:
Yolov8_model_1_training.ipynb <br>
Trained YOLOv8s model weights obtained from the experimental study.<br>
demo website.py<br>
Model result.zip<br>


***Additional Project Materials***
Due to file size limitations and repository cleanliness, some supporting materials are not hosted directly on GitHub. <br>
These materials include:<br>
Full annotated fabric defect dataset (YOLO format)<br>
Android application package (.apk) for real-time mobile-based detection<br>
Additional experimental outputs and supporting files<br>
All supplementary materials are available at the following Google Drive link:<br>

These files are provided for academic verification, evaluation, and demonstration purposes.

***Defect Classes: The model is trained to detect the following fabric defect classes:***
Hole<br>
Knot<br>
Line<br>
Stain<br>

***Frameworks & Tools:***
Python<br>
Ultralytics YOLOv8<br>
Jupyter Notebook<br>
OpenCV<br>
Streamlit (for web-based demo)<br>

***Notes:***
Large datasets and deployment files are intentionally excluded from the GitHub repository.<br>
The repository is intended to support reproducibility and academic review.<br>
The project was developed as part of the B.Sc. in Textile Engineering (Fabric Engineering) program.<br>
