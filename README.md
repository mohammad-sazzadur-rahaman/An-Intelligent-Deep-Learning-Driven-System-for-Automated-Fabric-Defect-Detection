*Fabric Defect Detection using YOLOv8 Overview*

This repository contains the core implementation files for the undergraduate thesis:

**“An Intelligent Deep Learning–Driven System for Automated Fabric Defect Detection”**

The project focuses on detecting and localizing fabric defects using the YOLOv8 object detection framework, along with a lightweight web-based demonstration system.

***Repository Contents***
The following files are included in this GitHub repository:
Yolov8_model_1_training.ipynb
Jupyter Notebook used for dataset preparation, YOLOv8 model training, validation, and evaluation.
best.pt
Trained YOLOv8s model weights obtained from the experimental study.
demo website.py
Python script for a simple web-based fabric defect detection demo using the trained YOLOv8 model.
Model result.zip
Archived output files related to model training and evaluation results.
README.md
Project description and usage information.

***Additional Project Materials***
Due to file size limitations and repository cleanliness, some supporting materials are not hosted directly on GitHub.
These materials include:
Full annotated fabric defect dataset (YOLO format)
Android application package (.apk) for real-time mobile-based detection
Additional experimental outputs and supporting files
All supplementary materials are available at the following Google Drive link:

These files are provided for academic verification, evaluation, and demonstration purposes.

***Defect Classes: The model is trained to detect the following fabric defect classes:***
Hole
Knot
Line
Stain

***Frameworks & Tools:***
Python
Ultralytics YOLOv8
Jupyter Notebook
OpenCV
Streamlit (for web-based demo)

***Notes:***
Large datasets and deployment files are intentionally excluded from the GitHub repository.
The repository is intended to support reproducibility and academic review.
The project was developed as part of the B.Sc. in Textile Engineering (Fabric Engineering) program.
